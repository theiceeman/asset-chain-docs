# Asset Chain Liquidity Mining Program

The **Asset Chain Liquidity Mining Program** is a strategic initiative aimed at deepening on-chain liquidity and rewarding participants for their engagement. Users earn points for performing various tasks within the Asset Chain ecosystem. These points will be redeemable at the end of the program for exclusive rewards.

This program incentivizes participation across decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, referral growth, and social engagement, all while contributing to the success of Asset Chain.

## 🌉 Bridging

**Bridging** means transferring tokens from another blockchain to Asset Chain.

- Use the official bridge: [https://bridge.assetchain.org](https://bridge.assetchain.org)
- Or any supported ecosystem bridge

### 🧮 Bridging Points Formula

```text
Points = base × √(amount in USD)
```

- `base` is a predefined point multiplier
- `amount` is the USD value of the bridged token

> **Note:** Bridging points are initially marked as **locked**. They are **unlocked** only after:
> - The bridged token is used to **create a liquidity position**, and
> - The position is **locked for at least 30 days**

---

## 🔄 Swapping (Trading)

**Swapping** refers to trading one token for another within Asset Chain. Supported platforms include:

- Official DEX: [https://swap.assetchain.org](https://swap.assetchain.org)
- Other decentralized exchanges on Asset Chain

### 🧮 Swapping Points Formula

```text
Points = base × √(amount in USD)
```

Higher-value trades result in more points. Your trades only get points if the value of your trade is 5 USD or more.

---

## 🔒 Locking Liquidity Positions

Providing liquidity means depositing token pairs into liquidity pools. Locking that liquidity increases point rewards.

### 🧮 Locked Liquidity Points Formula

```text
Points = base × lock duration multiplier
```

- Longer lock durations yield higher multipliers
- Locked positions help stabilize the protocol and benefit the entire ecosystem
