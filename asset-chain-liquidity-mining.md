# 👷‍♂️ Liquidity Mining

The **Asset Chain Liquidity Mining Program** is a strategic initiative aimed at deepening on-chain liquidity and rewarding participants for their engagement. Users earn points for performing various tasks within the Asset Chain ecosystem. These points will be redeemable at the end of the program for exclusive rewards.

This program incentivizes participation across decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, referral growth, and social engagement, all while contributing to the success of Asset Chain.

The Asset Chain team reserves the right to modify point formulas, reward structures, and program rules at any time. Participation does not guarantee rewards and is subject to change without notice.

## 🚀 Gas Station

The **Asset Chain Gasoline Station** ensures users have enough gas fees (in **RWA tokens**) to perform basic on-chain operations.

> You can claim free gas to interact with dApps such as swapping, bridging, and liquidity provision on the Asset Chain Network.

## 🌉 Bridging

**Bridging** means transferring tokens from another blockchain to Asset Chain.

* Use the official bridge: [https://bridge.assetchain.org](https://bridge.assetchain.org)
* Or any supported ecosystem bridge

### 🧮 Bridging Points Formula

```
Points = base × √(amount in USD)
```

* `base` is a predefined point multiplier
* `amount` is the USD value of the bridged token

> **Note:** Bridging points are initially marked as **locked**. They are **unlocked** only after:
>
> * The bridged token is used to **create a liquidity position**,
> * The position becomes **locked**
> * Once you lock your position, it takes 24 hours max for your locked points to become unlocked.
> * There is a maximum of 100 points for every bridge points you get i.e. if after your calculation of points and you have more than 100, only 100 points will be given.

## 🔄 Swapping (Trading)

**Swapping** refers to trading one token for another within Asset Chain. Supported platforms include:

* Official DEX: [https://swap.assetchain.org](https://swap.assetchain.org)
* Other decentralized exchanges on Asset Chain

### 🧮 Swapping Points Formula

```
Points = base × √(amount in USD)
```

Higher-value trades result in more points. Your trades only get points if the value of your trade is 40 USD or more.

***
> **Note:** :
>
> * Your trades only gets points when you trade 40 USD worth of tokens or more in recognized pools here,
> * There is a maximum of 100 points for every swap points you get i.e. if after your calculation of points and you have more than 100, only 100 points will be given.

## 🔒 Locking Liquidity Positions

Providing liquidity means depositing token pairs into liquidity pools. Locking that liquidity increases point rewards.

### 🧮 Locked Liquidity Points Formula

```
Points = base × lock duration multiplier
```

* Longer lock durations yield higher multipliers
* Locked positions help stabilize the protocol and benefit the entire ecosystem

## 📈 Liquidity Pool APR
Annual Percentage Return (APR) is the estimated annual yield for a specific pool. For example, the USDT/cNGN 0.3% fee tier pool generates returns based on trading volume and the total value locked (TVL) in that pool. Higher trading activity and lower TVL typically result in higher APR for liquidity providers.

***

## 🚫 Rules & Disqualification

To ensure fairness, participants must only use one account and avoid any form of manipulation, including wash trading, Sybil attacks, or exploiting smart contracts or reward systems. Any attempt to game the system may result in point removal, leaderboard reset, or permanent disqualification.

The Asset Chain team reserves the right to disqualify users at its discretion for suspicious behavior, abuse of referral systems, or failure to comply with program rules. All decisions are final, and disqualified users forfeit any unclaimed rewards.
