# ðŸ”µ Introducing Asset Chain

### What is Asset Chain? <a href="#what-is-fantom" id="what-is-fantom"></a>

Asset Chain is the native blockchain for Xend Finance Real-World Asset OAE (Onchain Asset Environment); with its consensus based on Fantom's Lachesis consensus.

This enables a fast, scalable, and secure smart contract platform.

[Lachesis](https://docs.fantom.foundation/technology/lachesis-abft) is a revolutionary aBFT consensus mechanism, that allows Asset Chain to be faster and cheaper than previous technologies while retaining security.

Asset Chain is:

* Permissionless
* Decentralized
* Open source

### Key features <a href="#key-features" id="key-features"></a>

#### Speed <a href="#speed" id="speed"></a>

Asset Chain achieves transaction finality in 1â€“2 seconds on average.

**Scalability**

Asset Chain can process up-to 5000 transactions per second and can scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes.

**Security**

The Lachesis consensus provides institutional-grade security to the distributed network. Asset Chain offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality.

Asset Chain is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security does not rely on a small set of actors in charge of block production.

**Smart Contract Support**

Asset Chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum.

### Get started <a href="#get-started" id="get-started"></a>

Here are some useful links to get you started:

* [Deploy a smart contract](quick-start.md)
* [Bridge on Asset Chain](../tools/bridge.md)
* [Operate a Node](../tools/operate-a-node.md)

### Reference

Asset Chain is built on [Fantom's](https://fantom.foundation/) revolutionary Lachesis consensus mechanism. Special thanks to the Fantom team.
