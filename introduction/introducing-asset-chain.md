# ðŸ”µ Introducing Asset Chain

### What is AssetChain? <a href="#what-is-fantom" id="what-is-fantom"></a>

AssetChain (a fork of the Fantom blockchain), is a fast, scalable, and secure smart contract platform built on an aBFT consensus protocol.

AssetChain is:

* Permissionless
* Decentralized
* Open source

[Lachesis](https://docs.fantom.foundation/technology/lachesis-abft), its revolutionary aBFT consensus mechanism, allows AssetChain to be faster and cheaper than previous technologies while retaining security.

### Key features <a href="#key-features" id="key-features"></a>

#### Speed <a href="#speed" id="speed"></a>

AssetChain achieves transaction finality in 1â€“2 seconds on average.

#### Scalability <a href="#scalability" id="scalability"></a>

AssetChain can process thousands of transactions per second and can scale to hundreds of nodes.

#### Security <a href="#security" id="security"></a>

Lachesis provides institutional-grade security to the distributed network. AssetChain offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality.

AssetChain is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security does not rely on a small set of actors in charge of block production.

#### Smart contract support <a href="#smart-contract-support" id="smart-contract-support"></a>

AssetChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum.
