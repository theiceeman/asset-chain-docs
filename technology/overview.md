# ‚è© Overview

Asset Chain is a decentralized, open-source, smart contract platform that aims to provide fast, secure, and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps).

The platform is designed as a next-generation blockchain platform to address several limitations of existing blockchains. Lachesis, a revolutionary [**aBFT consensus protocol**](https://docs.fantom.foundation/technology/lachesis-abft)**,** has made Asset Chain faster and cheaper than previous technologies while retaining security.

Asset Chain's key differentiating factor from other smart contract platforms is its focus on improving the performance of the underlying distributed ledger, meaning no segmentation between different networks, thereby not trading security for performance.
