# ðŸ’± Transaction Fees

### Basics <a href="#basics" id="basics"></a>

Each transaction on Asset Chain requires a transaction fee paid to the network in order to prevent spam attacks and reward validators for processing transactions. The fee is paid in RWA (Asset Chain's native token).

### Rewards distribution <a href="#rewards-distribution" id="rewards-distribution"></a>

Rewards distribution is fully controlled by our Special Fee contract. The Special Fee contract can be upgraded by governance at any time without a hard fork. The current distribution of transaction fees are:

* 20% to the Ecosystem Treasury
* 80% to Validators
