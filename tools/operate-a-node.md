# üèóÔ∏è Operate a Node

As the first blockchain explicitly designed for legally compliant asset tokenization and management, we recognize that our own nodes are assets too and should be tokenized accordingly.

This approach will lead to the full tokenization of Asset Chain nodes, integrating them into the very blockchain they run. This innovative setup creates what we refer to as 'liquid nodes,' a unique infrastructure that enhances the blockchain's functionality and accessibility.

Asset Chain supports 2 types of nodes

* Liquid nodes&#x20;
* Standalone nodes

_Please refer to a visualization of this innovative approach below:_
